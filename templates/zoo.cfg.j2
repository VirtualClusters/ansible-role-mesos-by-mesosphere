# Description of these configuration settings

# tickTime: the length of a single tick, which is the basic time unit used by ZooKeeper, as measured in milliseconds.
# dataDir: the location where ZooKeeper will store the in-memory database snapshots and, unless specified otherwise, the transaction log of updates to the database.
# dataLogDir: This option will direct the machine to write the transaction log to the dataLogDir rather than the dataDir. This allows a dedicated log device to be used, and helps avoid competition between logging and snaphots.
# clientPort: the port to listen for client connections; that is, the port that clients attempt to connect to.
# initLimit: Amount of time, in ticks (see tickTime), to allow followers to connect and sync to a leader. Increased this value as needed, if the amount of data managed by ZooKeeper is large.
# syncLimit: Amount of time, in ticks (see tickTime), to allow followers to sync with ZooKeeper. If followers fall too far behind a leader, they will be dropped.
